## Introduction

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

## Analytics

I created a dashboard using Power BI to find some useful insights for Danny's Diner. The dashboard gathers the following information:

* Total Sales of the Diner
* Total Number of Customers
* Most Popular Menu Item
* Sales Breakdown by Menu Items
* Customers with the highest spend
* Effect of membership on sales

From the above dashboard, it can be concluded that:

* Ramen is the most popular item at Danny's Diner, contributes to 51.61% of top 3 product sales
* Highest sales was made on 1st Jan, 2021
* Customer A has spent less after taking membership, while the case is opposite for customer B

Note:

* The list of conclusion in non-exhaustive.
* The top 3 pie chart has been added just to monitor top three menu items. Although in this dataset has a total of three menu items.
* This dashboard is made as an example of beginner Data Analytics Project. While this is a good start, real-life applications are way more complex.
